Variations of phở may also feature chicken, tofu, or other proteins, reflecting its versatility and widespread appeal.",

This flavorful dish features thick, cylindrical rice vermicelli noodles immersed in a rich broth infused with lemongrass and fermented shrimp sauce, offering a harmonious blend of spicy, salty, and savory flavors.\nThe broth is traditionally prepared by simmering beef bones and shank with lemongrass, then seasoning with fermented shrimp sauce and sugar.

  "com_tam_long_xuyen_desc": "Cơm tấm Long Xuyên is a distinctive variation of Vietnam's broken rice dish, originating from Long Xuyên city in An Giang province. This version is characterized by its use of finely milled broken rice grains, which are smaller and create a tender, melt-in-the-mouth texture.

A sweet and sour fish sauce accompanies the meal, enhancing its rich flavors.",

  "@__POPULAR_FOOD_HISTORY__": {},
  "pho_history": "Phở, Vietnam's iconic noodle soup, emerged in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam, particularly in the Nam Định province and Hanoi. Its creation is often attributed to the fusion of local culinary practices with French and Chinese influences during the colonial era. The French colonial presence increased the demand for beef, leading to a surplus of beef bones. Resourceful Vietnamese cooks utilized these bones to craft a rich, aromatic broth, combining it with rice noodles—a staple influenced by Chinese cuisine. This harmonious blend resulted in the birth of phở. Initially, phở was a simple dish sold by street vendors, but over time, it evolved, incorporating various herbs and spices, and spread throughout Vietnam and beyond, becoming a symbol of Vietnamese culinary tradition.",
  "bun_bo_hue_history": "Bún bò Huế is a traditional Vietnamese beef noodle soup that originates from Huế, the former imperial capital located in central Vietnam. Renowned for its robust and spicy broth, the dish has a rich history intertwined with the region's cultural heritage.\n\nThe exact origins of bún bò Huế are subject to various accounts. Some narratives trace its inception back to the 16th century during the reign of Lord Nguyễn Hoàng. According to legend, a woman named Ms. Noodles (\"Cô Bún\") from the village of Cổ Tháp ingeniously combined tender beef with a flavorful broth, creating what is now known as bún bò Huế. \nVINPEARL.COM\n\nAnother perspective suggests that the dish was crafted to satisfy the palates of emperors, epitomizing the essence of Huế—a blend of refinement and robustness. \nSANHOTELSERIES.COM\n\nRegardless of its precise origin, bún bò Huế has evolved over centuries to become a beloved staple of Vietnamese cuisine. Its distinctive combination of spicy, sour, sweet, and salty flavors, along with the aromatic infusion of lemongrass and shrimp paste, reflects the rich culinary traditions of Huế and continues to captivate food enthusiasts both within Vietnam and around the world.",

  "pho_recipe_step_2": "Peel the onion, wash it thoroughly, and let it drain. Cut one onion in half for roasting later, while thinly slicing the other two.\nPeel the shallots, then wash them along with the green onions and ginger. Finely chop the green onion leaves, and cut the white stalks into four lengthwise sections.\nPlace the halved onion, shallots, and ginger in a pan and roast over low to medium heat for 3–5 minutes until they become fragrant and slightly charred, then turn off the heat.\nUsing the same pan, add the pho seasoning spices and dry-roast over medium heat for about 4–6 minutes until aromatic. Transfer the spices immediately into a filter bag and tie it securely.",
  "pho_recipe_step_3": "Place the blanched beef bones, brisket, pho spice bag, and the roasted ingredients from step 2 into a pressure cooker.\nAdd enough water to cover the ingredients, along with 1 teaspoon of salt. Close the lid and simmer for 30 minutes until the beef is tender and the broth develops a naturally sweet flavor.\nAfter that, remove all the ingredients and cut the brisket into bite-sized pieces, about the length of three finger joints.\nTransfer the broth to a large pot to continue cooking. Place it back on the stove and return the spice bag to the pot, simmering over medium heat.\nAdd 200g of rock sugar, 2 tablespoons of seasoning powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of MSG, then stir well.\nLet the broth simmer for another 5–7 minutes until it reaches a rolling boil. Adjust the seasoning to taste, then remove the spice bag, and the broth is ready.",

Immediately pour the hot broth over the raw beef to lightly cook it and distribute the broth evenly.\nSprinkle some ground pepper on top, add fresh herbs, and it's ready to enjoy! The rich, naturally sweet broth pairs perfectly with the chewy pho noodles and tender, flavorful beef, enhanced by the fragrant roasted spices, onions, and ginger.\nServe it up and enjoy this delicious meal with your family!",

  "@__BUN_BO_HUE_RECIPE__": {},
  "bun_bo_hue_recipe_step_1": "If you prefer more meat in your pork hock, choose the hind hock, but if you enjoy chewy skin and tendons, the front hock is the better option. Cut the pork hock into circular slices and wash them thoroughly.\n\nBlanch the pork hock in boiling water to remove impurities, then rinse it again with clean water.\n\nClean the beef brisket thoroughly, then boil it separately with half a sliced ginger root to add fragrance. Simmer over low heat for about two hours, then test its tenderness by piercing it with chopsticks—if they pass through easily, the meat is fully cooked. Allow the brisket to cool, then slice it thinly before serving.",
  "bun_bo_hue_recipe_step_2": "Beef or pork blood can be bought pre-cooked or purchased fresh and then boiled until fully cooked before slicing into bite-sized pieces. It is important to buy blood from reputable sources to ensure food safety. If you do not eat blood, you can simply omit it from the dish.\n\nCrab cakes should be shaped into small round pieces and dropped into the pot of simmering beef brisket broth. Once they float to the surface, they are fully cooked and can be removed and set aside. You can replace crab cakes with beef cakes, pork rolls, or leave them out altogether if preferred.\n\nFour stalks of lemongrass should be finely chopped, while the remaining ones should be cut into sections and lightly pounded. The onion should be divided into two portions—one half cut in half, and the other thinly sliced.\n\nGreen onions, Vietnamese cilantro, and Thai basil should be washed thoroughly and finely chopped. All accompanying vegetables should also be washed and drained before serving.",
  "bun_bo_hue_recipe_step_3": "Dissolve two tablespoons of fermented shrimp paste (mắm ruốc) in 100 ml of cold water.\n\nSauté four finely chopped lemongrass stalks in two tablespoons of oil until fragrant. Remove some of the lemongrass, then add three tablespoons of annatto oil. Finely mince one onion, one garlic bulb, and two chili peppers, then add them to the pan and fry until golden before turning off the heat.\n\nPlace the prepared pork hock into a pot and simmer over low heat with a halved onion and three lightly pounded lemongrass stalks. This helps to enhance the sweetness and fragrance of the broth while extracting the full flavor from the bones. Be sure to occasionally skim off any foam to keep the broth clear.\n\nCarefully pour only the top layer of the fermented shrimp paste mixture into the broth, discarding the residue at the bottom. Add two tablespoons of sugar, two tablespoons of seasoning powder, and one tablespoon of salt, then adjust the seasoning to taste.\n\nFinally, mix in the chili satay oil prepared earlier.",
  "bun_bo_hue_recipe_step_4": "Blanch the rice noodles in boiling water, then drain and transfer them to a serving bowl.\n\nAdd slices of beef brisket, pork hock, crab cakes, blood pudding, Vietnamese cilantro, finely chopped green onions, and a few thin slices of onion. Finally, ladle the hot broth over the ingredients.\n\nBún Bò Huế is best enjoyed with bean sprouts, banana blossom, Thai basil, and a bit of chili paste for an extra kick of flavor.",
